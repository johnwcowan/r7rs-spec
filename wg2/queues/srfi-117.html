<H1>Abstract</H1>

<p>
Queues (more precisely, mostly-output-restricted deques) are mutable ordered collections that can contain any Scheme object.  Each queue is based on an ordinary Scheme list that contains the elements of the queue by maintaining pointers to the first and last pairs of the list.  It's cheap to add or remove elements from the front of the list or to add elements to the back, but not to remove elements from the back.  Queues are disjoint from other types of Scheme objects.
</p>

<H1>Issues</H1>

<p>No issues at present.</p>

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<p>The queues described in this SRFI are objects of a disjoint type that provide an ordered sequence of arbitrary Scheme objects.  Like lists, they provide sequential access to their elements; unlike lists, they normally should not share storage with other queues, unless special precautions have been taken.</p>

<p>Technically, a queue is an object that makes it efficient to remove elements from the front and to add elements to the back.  These queues also make it efficient to add elements to the front, but removing elements from the back is inefficient.  Therefore, because these objects do not provide the normal behavioral guarantees of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue">deques</a>, they are not referred to as deques.  True deques will be provided in a future SRFI.</p>

<p>Historically, objects of this form were called "tconc structures" (where "tconc" is short for "tail concatenate"), and Lispers have tended to roll their own using pairs.  This version uses a record to hold the first-pair and last-pair pointers rather than a pair, but uses pairs and the empty list internally.</p>

<p>Because the representation of queues as lists is exposed by the implementation, it's not necessary to provide a comprehensive API for queues.  Instead, <a class="ext-link" href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-1/srfi-1.html">SRFI 1</a> and other list APIs can serve the same purpose, using the conversion procedures to convert between queues and lists fairly cheaply.  Consequently, the API provided here over and above the bare necessities of queueing and dequeueing elements is closely analogous to the R7RS-small API for lists.  It also subsumes the <a class="ext-link" href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/man/4/Unit%20data-structures#queues">Chicken</a> and <a class="ext-link" href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/slib/Queues.html#Queues">​SLIB</a> APIs.</p>

<h2 id="Constructors">Constructors</h2>
<p>
<tt>(make-queue </tt><em>k</em> [ <em>fill</em> ]<tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns a newly allocated queue containing <em>k</em> elements.  If <em>fill</em> is provided, each element is equal to it; otherwise, the elements have unspecified values.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue </tt><em>element</em> ...<tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns a newly allocated queue containing the <em>elements</em>.  This operation is O(n).
</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue-copy </tt><em>queue</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns a newly allocated queue containing the elements of <em>queue</em>.  This operation is O(n).
</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue-unfold </tt><em>stop? mapper successor seed</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>Creates a newly allocated empty queue, and performs the following algorithm:</p>

<p>If the result of applying the predicate <em>stop?</em> to <em>seed</em> is <tt>#f</tt>, return the queue.  Otherwise, apply the procedure <em>mapper</em> to <em>seed</em>, returning a value which is added to the back of the queue.  Then get a new seed by applying the procedure <em>successor</em> to <em>seed</em>, and repeat this algorithm.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue-unfold-right </tt><em>stop? mapper successor seed</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>Creates a newly allocated empty queue, and performs the following algorithm:</p>

<p>If the result of applying the predicate <em>stop?</em> to <em>seed</em> is <tt>#f</tt>, return the queue.  Otherwise, apply the procedure <em>mapper</em> to <em>seed</em>, returning a value which is added to the front of the queue.  Then get a new seed by applying the procedure <em>successor</em> to <em>seed</em>, and repeat this algorithm.</p>
<p>
<tt>(make-queue-with-list </tt><em>list</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns a newly allocated queue containing the elements of <em>list</em> in order.  The result shares storage with <em>list</em>.  This operation is O(n).
</p>
<p>
To apply a non-destructive list procedure to a queue and return a new queue, use <tt>(make-queue-with-list (</tt><em>proc</em><tt> (queue-list </tt><em>queue</em><tt>)))</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(make-queue-with-first-last </tt><em>front back</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns a newly allocated queue containing the elements of the list whose first pair is <em>first</em> and whose last pair is <em>last</em>.  It is an error if the pairs do not belong to the same list.  Alternatively, both <em>first</em> and <em>last</em> can be the empty list.  The result shares storage with the list.  This operation is O(1).

</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue-empty? </tt><em>queue</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns <tt>#t</tt> if <em>obj</em> is a queue with no elements, and <tt>#f</tt> otherwise.  This operation is O(1).

<p>
<tt>(queue-first-last </tt><em>queue</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns two values, the first and last pairs of the list that contains the members of <em>queue</em> in order.  If <em>queue</em> is empty, returns two empty lists.  The results share storage with the queue.  This operation is O(1).
</p>
<h2 id="Mutators">Mutators</h2>
<p>
<tt>(queue-add-front! </tt><em>queue</em><tt> </tt><em>element</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Adds <em>element</em> to the beginning of <em>queue</em>.  Returns an unspecified value.  This operation is O(1).
</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue-add-back! </tt><em>queue</em><tt> </tt><em>element</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue-remove-front! </tt><em>queue</em><tt>)</tt>

</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue-remove-back! </tt><em>queue</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Removes the last element of <em>queue</em> and returns it.  If the queue is empty, an error is signaled.  This operation is O(n), because the list does not have backward links.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue-remove-all! </tt><em>queue</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Removes all the elements of <em>queue</em> and returns them in order as a list.  Returns an unspecified value.  This operation is O(1).
</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue-clear! </tt><em>queue</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<tt>(set-queue-from-list! </tt><em>queue list</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>

<h2 id="Thewholequeue">The whole queue</h2>
<p>
<tt>(queue-length </tt><em>queue</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue-append </tt><em>queue</em> ...<tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns a queue which contains all the elements in all the <em>queues</em> in the order in which they appear in the call.  The result does not share storage with any of the arguments.  This operation is O(n) in the total number of elements.
</p>

<tt>(queue-concatenate </tt><em>list-of-queues</em> ...<tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns a queue which contains all the elements in all the queues which are members of <em>list-of-queues</em> in the order in which they appear.  The result does not share storage with any of the arguments.  This operation is O(n) in the total number of elements.

<h2 id="Mapping">Mapping</h2>
<p>
<tt>(queue-map </tt><em>proc queue</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue-map! </tt><em>proc queue</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Applies <em>proc</em> to each element of <em>queue</em> in order and modifies <em>queue</em> to contain the results.  This operation is O(n).  It is not part of the R7RS-small list API, but is included here to make transformation of a queue by mutation more efficient.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(queue-for-each </tt><em>proc</em><tt> </tt><em>queue</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Applies <em>proc</em> to each element of <em>queue</em> in order, discarding the returned values.  Returns an unspecified value.  This operation is O(n).
