Boxes

<H1>Abstract</H1>

his is a trivial module, providing objects with a single mutable state. Several Schemes have something like it, sometimes called cells. Boxes are a disjoint type.  A box is like a single-element vector, normally used as minimal mutable storage.  These procedures implement the box data type. A box is a cell containing a single mutable field.  SISC supports boxes, a container for a Scheme value. Boxing is often used to implement call-by-reference semantics.  Boxes are single-cell objects that are primarily useful for providing an "extra level of indirection." This extra level of indirection is typically used to allow more than one body of code or data structure to share a reference, or pointer, to an object. For example, boxes may be used to implement call-by-reference semantics in an interpreter for a language employing this parameter passing discipline.  A box is a cell containing a single, mutable or immutable, field. The boxed value may be any Scheme type, including a variable or a location.  Cells are data structures similar to pairs except that they have only one element. They are useful for managing state.  These hold a single value and are useful when a simple indirection is required. The system uses these to hold the values of lexical variables that may be set!.
