\chapter{Lexical conventions}

This section gives an informal account of some of the lexical
conventions used in writing Scheme programs.  For a formal syntax of
Scheme, see section~\ref{BNF}.

\section{Identifiers}
\label{syntaxsection}

Most identifiers\mainindex{identifier} allowed by other programming
languages are also acceptable to Scheme.  The precise rules for forming
identifiers vary among implementations of Scheme, but in all
implementations, a sequence of letters, digits, and ``extended identifier
characters'' that does not have a prefix which is a valid number
is an identifier.  However, the  \ide{.} token used in the list syntax
is not an identifier.
Here are some examples of identifiers:

\begin{scheme}
lambda                   q
list->vector             +soup+
{+}                        V17a
<=?                      a34kTMNs
->string                 ...
the-word-recursion-has-many-meanings%
\end{scheme}

Extended identifier characters may be used within identifiers as if
they were letters.  The following are always permitted as alphabetic characters
(but implementations may allow a variety of other characters in identifiers):

\begin{scheme}
!\ \$ \% \verb"&" * + - . / :\ < = > ? @ \verb"^" \verb"_" \verb"~" %
\end{scheme}

In addition, any character can be used within an identifier when
specified via an \meta{inline hex escape}.  For example, the
identifier \verb|H\x65;llo| is the same as the identifier
\verb|Hello|, and in an implementation which has the appropriate
Unicode character the identifier \verb|\x3BB;| is the same as the
identifier $\lambda$.

As a convenience, identifiers may also be written as a sequence of
zero or more
characters enclosed within vertical bars ({\cf $|$}), analogous to
string literals.  Vertical bars and other characters can be included
in the identifier with an \meta{inline hex escape}.  Thus the
identifier \verb+|foo bar|+ is the same as the identifier
\verb+foo\x20;bar+.
Note that \verb+||+ is a valid identifier that is not equal to any other
identifier.

See section~\ref{extendedalphas} for a formal syntax of identifiers.

\vest Identifiers have two uses within Scheme programs:
\begin{itemize}
\item Any identifier may be used as a variable\index{variable}
 or as a syntactic keyword\index{syntactic keyword}
(see sections~\ref{variablesection} and~\ref{macrosection}).

\item When an identifier appears as a literal or within a literal
(see section~\ref{quote}), it is being used to denote a {\em symbol}
(see section~\ref{symbolsection}).
\end{itemize}

In contrast with earlier revisions of the report~\cite{R5RS}, the
syntax of data distinguishes between upper and lower case in
identifiers and in characters specified via their names.

Implementations may support case-insensitive syntax for backward
compatibility or for other reasons.
If they do so, they must support the following directives
to control case folding.

\begin{entry}{%
{\cf{}\#!fold-case}\sharpbangindex{fold-case}\\
{\cf{}\#!no-fold-case}\sharpbangindex{no-fold-case}}

These directives may appear anywhere comments may appear (see
section~\ref{wscommentsection})
and are treated as comments, except that they affect the reading
of subsequent data. The {\cf{}\#!fold-case} directive causes
the {\cf read} procedure to case-fold (as if by {\cf string-foldcase};
see section~\ref{stringsection}) each identifier and character name
subsequently read from the same port. The {\cf{}\#!no-fold-case} directive
causes the {\cf read} procedure to return to the default, non-folding behavior.
\end{entry}



\section{Whitespace and comments}
\label{wscommentsection}

\defining{Whitespace} characters are spaces and newlines.
(Implementations typically provide additional whitespace characters such
as tab or page break.)  Whitespace is used for improved readability and
as necessary to separate tokens from each other, a token being an
indivisible lexical unit such as an identifier or number, but is
otherwise insignificant.  Whitespace may occur between any two tokens,
but not within a token.  Whitespace may also occur inside a string,
where it is significant.

The lexical syntax includes several comment forms.  
Comments are treated exactly like whitespace.

A semicolon ({\tt;}) indicates the start of a line
comment.\mainindex{comment}\mainschindex{;}  The comment continues to the
end of the line on which the semicolon appears.  Comments are invisible
to Scheme, but the end of the line is visible as whitespace.  This
prevents a comment from appearing in the middle of an identifier or
number.

Another way to indicate a comment is to prefix a \hyper{datum}
(cf.\ section~\ref{datumsyntax}) with {\tt \#;}\sharpindex{;}, possibly with
\meta{whitespace} before the \hyper{datum}.  The comment consists of
the comment prefix {\tt \#;}, the space, and the \hyper{datum} together.  This
notation is useful for ``commenting out'' sections of code.

Block comments are indicated with properly nested {\tt
  \#|}\index{#"|@\texttt{\sharpsign\verticalbar}}\index{"|#@\texttt{\verticalbar\sharpsign}}
and {\tt |\#} pairs.

\begin{scheme}
\#|
   The FACT procedure computes the factorial
   of a non-negative integer.
|\#
(define fact
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0)
        \#;(= n 1)
        1        ;Base case: return 1
        (* n (fact (- n 1))))))%
\end{scheme}


\section{Other notations}

\todo{Rewrite?}

For a description of the notations used for numbers, see
section~\ref{numbersection}.

\begin{description}{}{}

\item[{\tt.\ + -}]
These are used in numbers, and may also occur anywhere in an identifier.
A delimited plus or minus sign by itself
is also an identifier.
A delimited period (not occurring within a number or identifier) is used
in the notation for pairs (section~\ref{listsection}), and to indicate a
rest-parameter in a  formal parameter list (section~\ref{lambda}).
Note that a sequence of two or more periods {\em is} an identifier.

\item[\tt( )]
Parentheses are used for grouping and to notate lists
(section~\ref{listsection}).

\item[\singlequote]
The single quote character is used to indicate literal data (section~\ref{quote}).

\item[\backquote]
The backquote character is used to indicate partly-constant
data (section~\ref{quasiquote}).

\item[\tt, ,@]
The character comma and the sequence comma at-sign are used in conjunction
with backquote (section~\ref{quasiquote}).

\item[\tt"]
The double quote character is used to delimit strings (section~\ref{stringsection}).

\item[\backwhack]
Backslash is used in the syntax for character constants
(section~\ref{charactersection}) and as an escape character within string
constants (section~\ref{stringsection}) and identifiers
(section~\ref{extendedalphas}).

% A box used because \verb is not allowed in command arguments.
\setbox0\hbox{\tt \verb"[" \verb"]" \verb"{" \verb"}"}
\item[\copy0]
Left and right square brackets and curly braces
are reserved for possible future extensions to the language.

\item[\sharpsign] Sharp sign is used for a variety of purposes depending on
the character that immediately follows it:

\item[\schtrue{} \schfalse{}]
These are the boolean constants (section~\ref{booleansection}).

\item[\sharpsign\backwhack]
This introduces a character constant (section~\ref{charactersection}).

\item[\sharpsign\tt(]
This introduces a vector constant (section~\ref{vectorsection}).  Vector constants
are terminated by~{\tt)}~.

\item[\sharpsign\tt u8(]
This introduces a bytevector constant (section~\ref{bytevectorsection}).  Bytevector constants
are terminated by~{\tt)}~.

\item[{\tt\#e \#i \#b \#o \#d \#x}]
These are used in the notation for numbers (section~\ref{numbernotations}).

\item[\tt{\#\hyper{n}= \#\hyper{n}\#}]
These are used for labeling and referencing other literal data (section~\ref{labelsection}).

\end{description}
