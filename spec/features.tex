\chapter{Standard Feature Identifiers}
\label{stdfeatures}

An implementation may provide any or all of the feature identifiers
listed below, as well as any others that it
chooses, but must not provide a feature identifier if it does not
provide the corresponding feature.  These features are used by {\cf
  cond-expand}.

\label{standard_features}

\feature{r7rs}{All \rsevenrs\ Scheme implementations have this feature.}
\feature{exact-closed}{All algebraic operations except {\cf /} produce
  exact values given exact inputs.}
\feature{ratios}{{\cf /} with exact arguments produces an exact result
  when the divisor is nonzero.}
\feature{exact-complex}{Exact complex numbers are provided.}
\feature{ieee-float}{Inexact numbers are IEEE 754 floating point
  values.}
\feature{full-unicode}{All Unicode characters are supported.}
\feature{windows}{This Scheme implementation is running on Windows.}
\feature{posix}{This Scheme implementation is running on a Posix
  system.}
\feature{unix, darwin, linux, bsd, freebsd, solaris, ...}{Operating
  system flags (more than one may apply).}
\feature{i386, x86-64, ppc, sparc, jvm, clr, llvm, ...}{CPU architecture flags.}
\feature{ilp32, lp64, ilp64, ...}{C memory model flags.}
\feature{big-endian, little-endian}{Byte order flags.}
\feature{\hyper{name}}{The name of this implementation.}
\feature{\hyper{name-version}}{The name and version of this
  implementation.}
