\clearextrapart{Introduction}

\label{historysection}

Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of
feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional
features appear necessary.  Scheme demonstrates that a very small number
of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are
composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language
that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming
paradigms in use today.

%Scheme has influenced the evolution of Lisp.
Scheme
was one of the first programming languages to incorporate first class
procedures as in the lambda calculus, thereby proving the usefulness of
static scope rules and block structure in a dynamically typed language.
Scheme was the first major dialect of Lisp to distinguish procedures
from lambda expressions and symbols, to use a single lexical
environment for all variables, and to evaluate the operator position
of a procedure call in the same way as an operand position.  By relying
entirely on procedure calls to express iteration, Scheme emphasized the
fact that tail-recursive procedure calls are essentially goto's that
pass arguments.  Scheme was the first widely used programming language to
embrace first class escape procedures, from which all previously known
sequential control structures can be synthesized.  A subsequent
version of Scheme introduced the concept of exact and inexact numbers,
an extension of Common Lisp's generic arithmetic.
More recently, Scheme became the first programming language to support
hygienic macros, which permit the syntax of a block-structured language
to be extended in a consistent and reliable manner.
% A few
%of these innovations have recently been incorporated into Common Lisp, while
%others remain to be adopted.

\todo{Ramsdell:
I would like to make a few comments on presentation.  The most
important comment is about section organization.  Newspaper writers
spend most of their time writing the first three paragraphs of any
article.  This part of the article is often the only part read by
readers, and is important in enticing readers to continue.  In the
same way, The first page is most likely to be the only page read by
many SIGPLAN readers.  If I had my choice of what I would ask them to
read, it would be the material in section 1.1, the Semantics section
that notes that scheme is lexically scoped, tail recursive, weakly
typed, ... etc.  I would expand on the discussion on continuations,
as they represent one important difference between Scheme and other
languages.  The introduction, with its history of scheme, its history
of scheme reports and meetings, and acknowledgements giving names of
people that the reader will not likely know, is not that one page I
would like all to read.  I suggest moving the history to the back of
the report, and use the first couple of pages to convince the reader
that the language documented in this report is worth studying.

\subsection*{Background}

\vest The first description of Scheme was written in
1975~\cite{Scheme75}.  A revised report~\cite{Scheme78}
\todo{italicize or not?} appeared in 1978, which described the evolution
of the language as its MIT implementation was upgraded to support an
innovative compiler~\cite{Rabbit}.  Three distinct projects began in
1981 and 1982 to use variants of Scheme for courses at MIT, Yale, and
Indiana University~\cite{Rees82,MITScheme,Scheme311}.  An introductory
computer science textbook using Scheme was published in
1984~\cite{SICP}.

%\vest As might be expected of a language used primarily for education and
%research, Scheme has always evolved rapidly.  This was no problem when
%Scheme was used only within MIT, but 
\vest As Scheme became more widespread,
local dialects began to diverge until students and researchers
occasionally found it difficult to understand code written at other
sites.
Fifteen representatives of the major implementations of Scheme therefore
met in October 1984 to work toward a better and more widely accepted
standard for Scheme.
%Participating in this workshop were Hal Abelson, Norman Adams, David
%Bartley, Gary Brooks, William Clinger, Daniel Friedman, Robert Halstead,
%Chris Hanson, Christopher Haynes, Eugene Kohlbecker, Don Oxley, Jonathan Rees,
%Guillermo Rozas, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Mitchell Wand.  Kent Pitman
%made valuable contributions to the agenda for the workshop but was
%unable to attend the sessions.
%
%Subsequent electronic mail discussions and committee work completed the
%definition of the language.
%Gerry Sussman drafted the section on numbers, Chris Hanson drafted the
%sections on characters and strings, and Gary Brooks and William Clinger
%drafted the sections on input and output.
%William Clinger recorded the decisions of the workshop and
%compiled the pieces into a coherent document.
%The ``Revised revised report on Scheme''~\cite{RRRS}
Their report~\cite{RRRS}
was published at MIT and Indiana University in the summer of 1985.
Further revision took place in the spring of 1986~\cite{R3RS},
%, again accomplished
%almost entirely by electronic mail, resulted in the present report.
and in the spring of 1988~\cite{R4RS}.
The present report reflects further revisions agreed upon in a meeting
at Xerox PARC in June 1992.

%\vest The number 3 in the title is part of the title, not a reference to
%a footnote.  The word ``revised'' is raised to the third power because
%the report is a revision of a report that was already twice revised.

We intend this report to belong to the entire Scheme community, and so
we grant permission to copy it in whole or in part without fee.  In
particular, we encourage implementors of Scheme to use this report as
a starting point for manuals and other documentation, modifying it as
necessary.
